We think you wanted to know. \n\n With your help, we aim to investigate how `SYCL 2023` resonates with its attendees. Participation is voluntary.\n\nThe data collected will be anonymized and used exclusively for research purposes, and all analyses will be carried out in such a way that no conclusions from the results can be drawn about the individual taking part.\n\nThe survey will take about 5 minutes of your time. You will be asked questions about your experience at `SYCL 2023`.\n\n### To participate in the study, please note the following:\n\n- Please participate in the survey **without interruption**. We have set a **maximum time of 5 minutes** for each respondent to participate.\n\n- You can **participate only once**. Participating more than once would be considered cheating.\n\n- Please **do not use the \"Back\"-button of your browser**. Be brave! Blaze through the survey in one go without looking back!\n\nThank you very much for your support.\n\n`If you would still like to participate in this study, please confirm the statements below and then click \"Continue\"`.",

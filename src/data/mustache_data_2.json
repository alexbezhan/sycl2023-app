For this, please imagine the following scenario:\n\n## Hurray!\n\nCongratulations, by a lucky coincidence you have unexpectedly received an amount of NIM-$ 10,000. Your friends recommend that you get a second opinion about a potential investment to optimize your profit. Just recently, you read something about a new financial advisory system, which prompted your couriosity. The system provides financial advice from a financial advisor called Emma that you decided to consult.\n\nToday is the day of your advisory meeting. During the meeting, the advisor will ask you about your financial situation as well as your risk affinity and provide you with an investment portfolio tailored to suit your individual needs.\n\nYou are free to decide how much money you would like to invest or not. Remember, money that is not invested will not change in value. Invested money will be subject to fluctuations and can either increase or decrease in value.\n\n**Important:** After making your investment decision, the investment will be simulated. Be aware that you will receive a performance-based payment according to your investment which is added to the general participation compensation of £ 2. The exchange rate is NIM-$ 1 = £ 0.0001.\n\nYou will only receive a payout if you complete the questionnaire.\n\n### If you are ready to start your advisory meeting, click „Continue“."
